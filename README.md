# Miscellanea

Miscellanea small things, tools and stuffs.

**You use any of them, if you actually use any of them, at your own
risk**. No efforts were made to make these things safe for
everyone. They are anything but meant to be user-friendly.

See also [the license](LICENSE) for the original stuff. It does
not apply if specified otherwise.

Sometimes you can find not necessarily brief, but likely mindless and
hopefully useful explanations in other files.
