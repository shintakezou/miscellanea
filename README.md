# Miscellanea

Miscellanea small things, tools and stuffs.

**You use any of them, if you actually use any of them, at your own
risk**. No efforts were made to make these things safe for
everyone. They are anything but meant to be user-friendly.

See also [the license](LICENSE) for the original stuff. It does not
apply if specified otherwise, e.g. if you find a LICENSE or COPYING
file inside a descendant directory.

If they exist, read also the READMEs in the subdirectories you are
interested in.
