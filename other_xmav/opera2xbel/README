You could need to play with URI::Escape and HTML::Entities,
since the php XML parser seems to be annoyed by both some special
unescaped char (and this is ok) and by unknown entities (I don't know
which entities are defined in XML files... I thought they were the same
as for HTML, but it seems to be not so)
