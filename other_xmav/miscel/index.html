<h1>Miscellanea scripts</h1>

<p>All these scripts are old enough but working.</p>

<p>All these scripts are mine.</p>

<p>All these scripts are released under <a href="COPYING">GPL</a>.</p>

<p>See inside sources and read them if you can!</p>

<p>This is a brief usage only doc, don't pretend too much.</p>



<h2><a href="scripts/asciilist.sh">asciilist.sh</a></h2>

<p>This is a Bash script. It happens (it happened to me) you need
to write specific <q>ASCII</q> bytes to a file or to a pipe. This script
does it.</p>

<pre>
asciilist.sh 0x63 0x69 0x71 0x6f 0x0a
</pre>

<p>For example writes to output "ciao" (followed by a LineFeed).
Decimal allowed too.</p>



<h2><a href="scripts/dothumb.pl">dothumb.pl</a></h2>

<p>A Perl wrapper to <tt>imlib</tt>'s <tt>create_scaled_image</tt>. You
give a file as first argument (the file must be an image!) and a height
in pixel. You obtain a scaled image file with a <tt>_th</tt> (thumb) added.</p>

<pre>
dothumb.pl navastro.png 256
</pre>

<p>This scales the <tt>navastro.png</tt> image file to a height of 256 pixels.
Beware of the fact the <tt>imlib</tt> recognises filetype by extension.</p>



<h2><a href="scripts/mgs2">mgs2</a></h2>

<p>This is a rather complex Bash script. What is its purpose? Why does
it exist? I can't remember if it was on Phreak or BFI or something like
that, however <q>there</q> they used to write articles with
embedded codes (e.g. in C), and provided a program that get those codes...</p>

<p>My <tt>mgs2</tt> is a Bash script that does this: parse file, extracting
<q>regions</q> of it according to preset identifiers. I can't remember
details because 1) I wrote it two years ago and 2) I've never used it!
(But it seems I tested it and it worked...)</p>

<p>It uses all sort of (GNU) tools: sed, egrep, awk, and of course
common *n*x tools like mkdir, mv, cat and so on... All the shell stuffs...
It does more: when getting C sources, it can append them for compiling!
(gcc is used); then, each <q>embedded</q> file has its own path and
this is created and so on...</p>

<p>A little bit confused? Yes I am too. Why doesn't it use <tt>mkdir -p</tt>?
Or why...? Well, then specific command per file can be executed, or
the compilation of C sources can be avoided...</p>

<pre>
mgs2 FILE
</pre>

<p>You maybe need an example to test on it and try to understand...
So I give you an example <a href="scripts/mgs/example.txt">here</a>.
First create a dir where you want your file, since current dir
is used and you likely don't want mgs messes it all up (?). Do something
like (from your preferred shell)</p>

<pre>
$ mkdir testdir &amp;&amp; cd testdir
$ path/to/mgs2 path/to/example.txt
</pre>

<p>Where <tt>$</tt> is the prompt so you know when you have to hit return.
If everything's fine, you will find 5 files: <tt>helloworld.c</tt> and its
executable (if compiling was successful), <tt>estratto.txt</tt>, <tt>code.c</tt> and
<tt>lesson.txt</tt>.</p>


<h2><a href="scripts/nocr.pl">nocr.pl</a></h2>


<p>It strips CR (Carriage Return) from a file/stream (it uses piping
so you can use it as a filter).</p>

<pre>
nocr.pl &lt;file.txt &gt;filenocr.txt
</pre>

<p>MS DOS and similar systems use the sequence of byte CR LF as
newline (in decimal the bytes' values are 13 10). Stripping the
CR gives the *n*x/Amiga convention for newline (just a single LF).
If you are dealing with Mac files (before of Mac OS X?) the newline
is the CR alone, so stripping it means creating a single long line.</p>
