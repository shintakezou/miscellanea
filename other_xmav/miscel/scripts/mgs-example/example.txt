The very short course for C beginners
=====================================

The C is a language for computer. The first simple example
is the overmost famousishy Hello World piece.

>>INIZIO------ helloworld.c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main()
  {
    printf("Hello world\n");
  }
>>FINE-----------------------------------------------------------<<

This fine program can be extracted by the mgs2 utility provided, simply
cd into the dir you want as destination and write

   mgs2 thisfile.txt

then magically all the things would be (maybe) compiled and all embedded
text extracted to a file.

>>INIZIO--------- estratto.txt
   For example this text is get by this file and put inside a file
   named estratto.txt, it is easy and it seems unuseful but it could
   be very interesting, right or wrongish?
>>FINE------------------------------------------------------<<


Now take a lock at tis:

>>INIZIO------------- code.c
/*nocc              */
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include "donotexist.h"

  int main()
  {
     printf("error!\n");
  }
>>FINE-----------------------------------------<<

This won't be compiled and it is a luck since it would fail!

That's all, find out yourself into the next stuff how to do a little bit
more thanks to Moore. Law is stupidity.

>>INIZIO----------- lesson.txt
  This lesson teaches us two simple fact, that you can add comments
  to a C file source file I mean so that extractor interprets some
  commands like *nocc for no compilink, *gcc for compilink, and
  *exec to execkuting so that all is now linked and completed. Don't
  you find that Miss Take is a very fine miss? Girls rule because of
  their counts, without those they will be like men. Someone told this
  to me, I am not sure I've understood since I know 2 is after 1,
  and after 2 comes 3 and so on, so, am I a woman?!
  Well enough kidding for now and on, watch your steps and never forget,
  I exist, so you exist, and hope you are a fine count and like a
  beach (never undestood why a easy girl is like a beach; I like sun,
  however, and that's all about).
>>FINE--------------------------------------------<<

That's all faults!
