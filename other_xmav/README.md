Other scripts from old “xmav” archives
======================================

If there are HTML files you want to read properly in your browser, try
~~rawgit~~… Rawgit is going to die (is dead), the suggested replacement
didn't do what `rawgit` did the way it did, but here it comes [htmlpreview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/)
which hopefully won't go away until github will stay.

- [cal](cal/): an example generated by the script:
  [2017](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shintakezou/miscellanea/blob/master/other_xmav/cal/2007.html).
- [fixrellink](fixrellink/)
- [htmlmanip](htmlmanip/):
  [HTML doc](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shintakezou/miscellanea/blob/master/other_xmav/htmlmanip/index.html)
- [killrecent](killrecent/):
  [HTML doc](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shintakezou/miscellanea/blob/master/other_xmav/killrecent/index.html)
- [marc](marc/): [HTML doc](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shintakezou/miscellanea/blob/master/other_xmav/marc/index.html)
- [miscel](miscel/): miscellanea inside a miscellanea!
  [HTML list](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shintakezou/miscellanea/blob/master/other_xmav/miscel/index.html)
- [opera2xbel](opera2xbel/): Opera6 to [XBEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBEL) bookmark format
- [pnggif](pnggif/): I didn't remember this, but it's interesting;
  I'll go hunting for the `msOG` chunk a day in the future!
- [yam](yam/): good old [YAM](https://yam.ch/) moved to
  [github](https://github.com/jens-maus/yam) and hasn't stuck in the
  old good times… if you want to export your address book as HTML,
  this script **did** it… and with modern version of YAM? I don't
  know!
