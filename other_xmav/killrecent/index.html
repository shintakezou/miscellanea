<h1>Kill recents (KDE)</h1>

<p>
It seems like KDE spread recents file almost everywhere... how to kill
them all? This script's purpose is this, but of course it can fail. Just
try it.

<p>
How does it work? It simply looks inside the kind of file KDE can store
recent information in, and then strip the line(s) containing the recent
information.
</p>

<p>
It does a backup you can of course remove. It looks inside
<tt>$HOME/.kde/share/config</tt> for files like XXXrc and
XXX.new ... then it checks inside <tt>kdeglobals</tt> too.
