Assorted tools
==============

Tools I don't know where to put.


calgen.pl
---------

Generate a relationship between our calendar and a perennial calendar
invented by me.

This calendar has a five days week, 12 months all made of 6 weeks,
that is 30 days, and four or fifth intercalary days, according to the
year being leap or not. Names of months and days of the week are in
Italian and I didn't care of the translation yet. I've written about
it in a couple of posts on my Italian blog.


extractmime.py
--------------

Extract MIME parts from an email message contained in a file.


wlemails.sh
-----------

Wikileaks allows to read emails through the web and to show also the
"Raw Email". This tool tries to extract the *raw email* from the web
page, and also attachments or other things which can be extracted by
[extractmime.py](extractmime.py), once the *raw email* message has
been saved.

Sometimes it seems like the *raw email* isn't available. Then you will
get a folder with empy files.
