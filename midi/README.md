# Collection of stuffs about MIDI

Reference site:
[MIDI specifications](https://www.midi.org/specifications).

The informations that I will collect here are taken from
[MIDI.org](https://www.midi.org) or are found elsewhere in the
Internet.

I am interested mainly in how MIDI files can be created and modified,
rather than in the protocol itself.
