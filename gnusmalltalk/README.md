Miscellanea for GNU Smalltalk
=============================

In case you want to use these, likely you should take a snapshot,
e.g. with

    ObjectMemory snapshot: 'extended.im'.
	
and then execute whatever you need to execute with this image
loaded. If you use `gst` from the command line, it will be

    gst -I extended.im aFileToBeRun.st
	
or alike.

As usual, use these things for any purpose **at your own risk**.
