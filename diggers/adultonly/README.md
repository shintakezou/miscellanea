Adults only
===========

If I remember well, these scripts were written between 2004 and 2008
(in the quick-and-dirty way, no pun intended). Their aim was to
mass-download adult images found on the net, on specific sites (by the
way, I can't remember all of them anymore).

Often there were explanations in `index.html` files I've converted
quickly into `README.md` files, hopefully without adding mistakes of
any kind.

These scripts are what they are and likely can't be used anymore also
on the site they were written for. Even if in theory you could adapt
them to other sitesâ€¦


Dependencies
------------

Some scripts use `ginlineimg` and `getaddrs`. These tools likely did
what their name suggests (get inline images and get addresses). They
weren't in these archives and I haven't searched for them yet, and
likely I won't.
