Takegooglelink
==============

In ancient times Google was giving simple pages with **real links**
and HTML comments which could be used to help extracting the result.

We can't say “thanks to the Google guys” anymore (and it's so since
many years ago). On the contrary, there's always a good reason to
curse an innocent Google gear. (It's the same for other companies, of
course.)
